            <br>
            <br>
           1. Mix flour, carom seeds, ghee and salt. Add sufficient water to knead it into a stiff dough. Divide the dough into portions and shape them into small balls. Place the baatis on the tray. Preheat oven to 250 C or ~480 F<br>
           <br><br>
2.Bake them at 250Â°C for about ten minutes. And after ten minutes, turn sides and bake for another ten minutes. This worked for me. You can always lower the temperature or change sides etc.<br>
<br><br>
3.Generally they are soaked in a bowl of melted desi ghee for some time before being served but I just shallow fried them in ghee in a pan and served with ghee so that people could add as desired. Remove from bowl before serving and serve with dal and ghee.<br>
