          <b> <big> How To Make Neer Dosa :</big></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Soak 1 cup rice in enough water for 4 to 5 hours or overnight. I generally soak overnight and then grind them the next day.<br>
            <br>
            2. Drain the soaked rice and add them in a wet grinder jar.<br>
            <br>
            3. Just add enough water for grinding the rice. If you add all the water then you won’t be able to grind the rice well.<br>
            <br>
            4. Grind to a smooth batter and then take it in another bowl or pan. The batter should not have tiny coarse particles of rice. If the grinder becomes hot,then <br>
               wait for some minutes and then grind again.<br>
               <br>
            5. Add more water to get a thin flowing watery consistency almost like that of milk. I added 2 cups of water for 1 cup of rice. The addition of water depends on <br>
               the quality and kind of rice.So add water accordingly. You can add from 1.5 to 2 cups of water.<br>
               <br>
            6. Add salt as required.</br>
            <br>
            7. In a cast iron pan or a non stick pan. Drizzle ½ tsp of oil. Before adding the oil, if using a cast iron pan, sprinkle some water to check the temperature of <br>
              the pan.If the water droplets sizzle and evaporate, then the pan is ready to make dosas.Avoid doing this method on a non stick pan as adding water on a hot non <br>
              stick pan, will affect the non stick coating.<br>
              <br>
            8. Just spread the oil all over with a spoon. You can also use a small piece of cotton kitchen towel to do the same.Or you can dip half of an onion in oil and smear<br>
               the pan with the halved onion.<br>
               <br>
            9. Stir the batter in the pan/bowl and take a ladle full of batter.<br>
            <br>
            10. Then pour the batter moving outwards to inside like the way we do for Rava dosa. or you can just spread the batter and tilt/rotate the pan. Do not spread the batter<br>
             with the back of the ladle like the way we do for regular dosas.<br>
             <br>
            11. Fill in the large gaps too with some of the batter.<br>
            <br>
            12. Cover with a lid and cook the neer dosa till done. Don’t brown it.<br>
            <br>
            13. Here the neer dosa is done. Neer dosa is never flipped.Just the base has to be cooked well. When the dosa is cooked, it separates from the pan.<br>
            <br>
            14. Make a triangular fold on the tawa itself.<br>
            <br>
            15. Then remove the dosa and place it in a plate. Make neer dosa this way and place them separately without them touching each other on a plate. Once they cool down, you<br>
             can keep them in a casserole or an airtight container/dabba.<br>
             <br>
            16. Serve neer dosa hot or warm with coconut chutney, potato sagu, veg kurma. Neer dosa remain soft even after they get cooled down. sSo you can serve them later too. <br>
