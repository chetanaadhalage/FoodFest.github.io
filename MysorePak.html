          <b> <big> Preparation for mysore pak :</big></b>
            <br>
            <br>
        
Firstly take all the 3 ingredients - 1.25 cups sugar (200 to 210 grams sugar), 1 cup besan (100 grams) and 1 cup ghee (200 to 210 grams).<br>
Seive the besan once or twice. This helps in reducing the lumps if any while mixing besan in the sugar syrup.<br>
Grease a pan or tray with some ghee. Use a pan or tray which can give you some depth and height, so that you can get rectangular or square pieces.

<b color=tomato ><big>How to make mysore pak</big></b><br>

1.Now take the sugar in a heavy thick bottomed kadai. Since a lot of stirring happens, I would suggest you to Use a heavy and large aluminium or<br> iron kadai. please do not use non stick pan as due to the heat and lot of stirring, the non stick coating can get affected.<br>
2.Add ½ cup water in the sugar.<br>
3.Keep the pan on the stove top. On a medium-low or medium flame, heat the sugar syrup.<br>
4.Stir so that the sugar dissolves.<br>
5.Meanwhile also take the ghee in another pan and keep it on stove top. let the ghee melt on a low flame or sim. The ghee has to be hot when <br> we add it in the besan mixture. So let it be on a slow simmer.<br>
6.Let the sugar syrup start bubbling and boiling. We are not looking for one string consistency in the sugar syrup. Just let the sugar solution<br> come to a boil and then add the besan.<br>
7.Add the besan in three to four parts. first add some of the besan.<br>
8.With a wired whisk, stir the besan briskly, so that it dissolves with the sugar solution.<br>
9.With one hand, add the besan and with the other hand mix it with a wired whisk.<br>
10.Finish of all the besan this way.<br>
11.Stir very well, so that the besan has got mixed evenly with the sugar syrup. <br>
<br>
<b>Adding ghee for making mysore pak</b><br>
<br>
1.Then add ghee in parts. First add a ladle full of the ghee.<br>
2.You will see a lot of bubbles and frothing in the besan mixture after you add ghee.<br>
3.As soon as you add ghee, mix it with the besan with a spoon or spatula. with one hand add ghee and with the other hand mix it.<br>
4.Then add the second part of ghee and again mix it very well. Keep the flame to a medium-low or medium.<br>
5.This way finish off adding all the ghee in parts. Mix very well.<br>
6.Do use a bigger kadai and also some gloves on your hands, as there is a lot of sizzling, frothing and bubbling that happens.<br>
7.All the ghee will be absorbed first and what you will see is a smooth molten besan mixture.<br>
8.On a medium-low to medium flame with non-stop stirring cook the besan mixture.<br>
9.You have to continue to cook and stir till you start seeing many bubbles in the mixture and the ghee is released from it. So continue <br>to cook and stir. the mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan.<br>
10.While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets<br> browned or burnt.<br>
11.So You have to non stop stir and scrape. do use flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the besan mixture.<br>
12.When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.<br>
13.When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the flame.<br>
14.If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak.<br><br>
<b>Setting mysore pak</b><br><br>

1.Immediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the pan. It falls in one lot and you don't need to use any spoon for it.<br>
2.Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.<br>
3.Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down. <br>
4.If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed.<br>
 You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates.<br>
5.Once warm or cooled down, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan.<br> the mysore pak block falls of easily.<br>
6.Then slice the mysore pak into rectangular or square pieces.<br>
7.Store in an air-tight container. It stays good for about a week to ten days at room temperature.<br>
